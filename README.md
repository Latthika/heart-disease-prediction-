# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict heart disease based on medical data. By leveraging algorithms such as Logistic Regression, CatBoost, Random Forest, and hybrid models, it aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

## Motivation
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for nearly 31% of global deaths. This project addresses the challenge by using machine learning to analyze patient data, identify risk factors, and provide early detection mechanisms.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes cross-validation and tuning techniques for optimal performance.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines Logistic Regression, CatBoost, and Random Forest for a 97% accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights using correlation heatmaps, ROC curves, and performance metric graphs.
